# Poros

> *Poros* — from the Greek word for "passage" or "way".

Poros is a work-in-progress client-side search redirector written in Rust using the Yew framework. It is inspired by DuckDuckGo's bang system, as well as open-source projects like [Unduck](https://github.com/t3dotgg/unduck) and [Rebang](https://github.com/Void-n-Null/rebang). You should check them out if you’re interested in similar projects.

## What it does

Poros allows users to define custom search prefixes (or "bangs") like `!yt` for YouTube or `!g` for Google, and redirects search queries accordingly entirely on the client side. It's designed to run fast, require no backend, and be easily deployable via GitHub Pages.
